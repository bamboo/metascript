Metascript

This is an attempt at creating a new language that compiles to Javascript.

The goal is to have a language that can have a readable syntax, and at the same time allow lisp-style metaprogramming (macros that can manipulate the AST).

Another goal is to have a type system, for optionally performing static type checking (with type inference).

Right now I only have the basic parser, more code will come "soon".
